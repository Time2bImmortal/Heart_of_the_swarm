This experimental setup is designed for studying insect behavior, leveraging a mouse sensor for movement detection and FicTrac for video recording analysis.
The system is built on the concept of an affordable, easy-to-use closed-loop framework, implemented in Python using a modular and multi-processing approach. 
The goal is to create a simple, customizable solution that can be enhanced and integrated with new features and improvements. It is completely free for any use.
